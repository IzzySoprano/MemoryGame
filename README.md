# Overview

For this milestone project, I wanted to create an interactive card matching game inspired by my favourite TV show, The Sopranos.
The game will be simple, to match the 20 character cards.
The game will also feature an interactive music player that will have the opening theme song of the show.

Developed and designed as part of Milestone Project 2: Interactive Frontend Development for Code Institute.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

- It's important for the site to follow the the color scheme from the show in order to create a feel that the game is inspired by the TV Show.
- The three main colours of the TV show are black, white and red. The title **The Sopranos** is shown in a white or red colour depending on the source. I have decided to go for the white colour as its the most common.

For the background, the colour will be black.

Each card will be blended into the black background, as the back of the card which will display the main title, will represent each card. Like this:

![Back of the Card](assets/img/Sopranos-Title.jpg)

## Fonts

No fonts will be added to the game.

## Imagery

The cards for the game will hold characters from the TV show. I have selected 20 characters from the show as the front of the card.

## Validation 
- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

   **Two Erros**
   ![Errors](assets/img/Testing/HTML-Errors.png)

   **Error 1**
   It seems that I have incorrectly added spacing to the file name which is causing the error. I've added dash 
   ![Error 1](assets/img/Testing/Error1.png)

   **Error 2**
   I added a `<h1>` tag to `<ul>` which made the `<h1>` tag the child element. W3 doesn't recognise this as valid, therefore I have moved the `<h1>` tag outside the `<ul>` tag

- ### **Device Testing**

For all my media queries, I used tutor support, and CSS **[A Complete Guide to CSS Media Queries](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/)** in getting my site responsive for all devices

The website was tested on the following devices:

**Browser**
   - Dell XPS 

**Mobile**
   -iPhone 8 / 8 Plus / X / 12

**Tablet**
   -iPad
   -iPad Pro

- Dev Tools was used to test the responsiveness on other devices

## Known Bugs

A bug occured towards the end of my project in which at some point in the game, a match or a flip would be broken as shown below.

[Bug](assets/img/Bugs/Bug.png)

I realised a reset wasn't being completed after the second card had been flipped, as the browser was checking to see if a match had been made after the first card had been clicked.

To solve this problem, I had to figure out a way to reset my array of flipped cards and reset my first card boolean after the first card had been clicked.
I declared a new variable that would be used to determine if the process of checking for a match should take place. The variable would then need to be set to true at the start of a flip and then reset back to false at the end of the process. It needed to be set to true at the start of a flip and then reset back to false at the end of the process in order to prevent the browser from checking if a match had been made after the first click.
